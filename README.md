## Waifu of the Day
Why need a Tip of the day when you can have Waifu of the Day. This feature replaces the out of the box Tip of the Day of IntelliJ and shows some *Waifu*!

*It only shows up once a day at the project startup, and you can view it at the 'Waifu Motivator' tool menu.*

## Waifu Startup Motivation
Your *Waifu* loves to welcome you, make sure to keep coming back!

## Waifu Unit Tester
Your *Waifu* motivates you whenever a test passes or fails.

**Test Pass**
![Test Pass](screenshots/waifu_unit_test_pass.gif)

*When a test passes it'll rejoice with you together with their voice/sound.*

**Test Fails**

*When a test fails it'll cheer you up for you to not get demotivated*

## Waifu Motivation On-demand
Whenever you feel demotivated on your task, you can request a motivation that randomly plays a sound, and notification to cheer you up. You can invoke it on `Help | Waifu Motivator | Motivate Me` or the shortcut key with (`alt + M` for Windows/Linux and `option + M` for MacOs).

## Waifu Settings
Of course, not all the time you're okay with your *Waifu*, there are bad times after all and sometimes you'll get annoyed by them and not wanting to hear anything from them. You can configure it through the settings (`Settings | Other Settings | Waifu Motivator`).
