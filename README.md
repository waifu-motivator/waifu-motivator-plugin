## Waifu of the Day
Why would you want the _Tip of the Day_, when instead you can have a _Waifu of the Day_?
This feature replaces the out-of-the-box Tip of the Day feature of IntelliJ with a top-tier *Waifu*!

</p>

*This only shows up once a day at the project startup, and you can also view it at the 'Waifu Motivator' tool menu.*

## Anime Memes (AMII)

</p>

Since Waifu Motivator `v2.0`, the [AMII plugin](https://github.com/ani-memes/AMII) now handles the notification events.
This includes not only Waifus, it has anything you can think of within the anime space!

Give your IDE more personality and have <emphasis>more</emphasis> fun programming with the **A**nime **M**eme **I**DE **I**ntegration! (AMII)<br/><br/>
Upon installation, our Meme Inference Knowledge Unit (or MIKU for short)
will begin interact with you as you build code.
MIKU knows when your programs fail to run or tests pass/fail.
Your new companion has the ability to react to these events.
Which will most likely take the form of an anime meme of your: waifu, husbando, and/or favorite character(s)!<br/><br/>

Please see [AMII's feature documentation](https://github.com/ani-memes/AMII/#documentation) for more information.

## Doki-Theme Integration

You can also install [Doki Theme](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-jetbrains) to have a better *Waifu* development experience!
