<p align="center">An open-sourced Jetbrains IDE plugin that brings in your <i>Waifu</i> to help motivate you to complete your coding challenges.</p>

**What is a Waifu?** ðŸ¤·

> *Waifu* is a term for a fictional character, usually in anime or related media, that someone has great, and sometimes romantic, affection for. [source](https://www.dictionary.com/e/fictional-characters/waifu/)

## Waifu of the Day
Why do you need the _Tip of the Day_, when instead you can have the _Waifu of the Day_?
This feature replaces the out of the box Tip of the Day of IntelliJ with a top-tier *Waifu*!

</p>

*It only shows up once a day at the project startup, and you can also view it at the 'Waifu Motivator' tool menu.*

## Motivation Events

Your virtual companion has the ability to react to various events trigger by your IDE.
As you build your code, they will present various visual notifications of their reactions.

### Starting Up
Your *Waifu* loves to welcome you, make sure to keep coming back!

### Test Runs

Your *Waifu* will motivate you whenever your tests pass or fail.

**Test Pass**

*When a test passes your companion will rejoice with you together with their voice/sound.*

**Test Fails**

*When a test fails they will cheer you up, so you can overcome your challenges/frustrations.*
_Also you don't want to disappoint you waifu, now do you?_

## Motivation On-demand
Whenever you feel demotivated on your task, you can request a motivation.
Your companion will randomly play a sound and show a *Waifu* to cheer you up.
You can invoke it on `Help | Waifu Motivator | Motivate Me` or the shortcut key with (`alt + M` for Windows/Linux and `option + M` for MacOs).

## Plugin Settings
Of course, not all the time you're okay with your *Waifu*, there are bad times after all and sometimes you'll get annoyed by them and not wanting to hear anything from them. You can configure it through the settings (`Settings | Other Settings | Waifu Motivator`).
