    "description": "Tomoko Kuroki (黒木 智子 Kuroki Tomoko) is the lead protagonist of No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys Fault I'm Not Popular! (\"Watamote\"). Socially inept and often desperate, the series chronicles her various attempts to try to be more popular at her school, Makuhari Shuuei High School. She is 15 years old at the time of the series' debut and was born towards the end of February of either 1994, 1997, or 1998.\n<h2>Character Overview</h2>Tomoko started off very excited about high school. After all, she had had over 50 years of dating experience with over 100 boys in otome games, and she could not have been more enthralled with the years of popularity her secondary education was bound to bring! However, after going two months without speaking to anyone in her class, Tomoko is baffled by her continuing lack of notoriety and becomes more determined than ever to gain her peers' approval. In both the manga and anime, Tomoko debuts looking up the definition of \"unpopular girl\"--\"mojyo\" spelled in the English titles later--on the internet only to discover she fits all of the criteria! In the anime opening titles, she is depicted as a prisoner having her pictures taken wearing a placard that identifies her as \"mojyo\" in English letters.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Tomoko has a grim outlook on life - so much that during a daydream she imagines herself on a motorcycle, only to crash and end up in the hospital. She utters a \"censored\" with a tone reference to the anime Gantz, hoping her world will be destroyed and replaced. As the initial series progresses, Tomoko tries to become popular by coming up with ideas on how to get attention. She usually either fails or receives negative attention. She often lacks a \"filter\" in that she will say what she thinks without considering the consequences.",

    "description": "Shiro (白しろ, Shiro) is the main female protagonist of the No Game No Life series and the calm and calculative half of the siblings.\nAbandoned by her parents, Shiro is an 11 year old genius NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) hikikomori (shut-in) gamer who, along with her step-brother, Sora, form 『　　』 (Blank). Sora's dad married Shiro's mother, both having remarried, thus making Shiro and Sora step-siblings.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Shiro is a pale-skinned girl with very long messy white hair with a pale blue, purple, pink, green, and yellow tint and large, passive golden/yellow-red eyes. She is rather slim and about average height (for an eleven-year-old).\n\nShe often wears a purple sailor uniform which may be a bit oversized, along with thigh high stockings.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Shiro is described as a genius in logic and problems, but has difficulty understanding emotions or behavior, relying on Sora to help her defeat beings with emotions such as Tet in their chess match. She also rarely shows much emotion at all and, despite her genius intellect, speaks in short, terse sentences and in a third-person perspective.\n<h2>Strengths</h2>Shiro has shown to be a genius with an almost supernatural intelligence, with incredible scientific calculation and simulation abilities. Like her brother, she possesses eidetic memory and is able to learn and recall a vast amount of information quickly and accurately. Sora has stated that she has beaten a chess program written to beat a grandmaster twenty times in a row, and she herself has stated that chess is no different from Tic-Tac-Toe. It has also been stated by Sora that she fluently speaks 18 languages, and learned to read Imanity in 15 minutes. She is also incredibly skilled in first-person shooters due to her ability to predict the movements and bullet trajectories of her opponents. These predictions are more focused on mathematical probability rather than psychological observation and deduction, unlike Sora.\n<h2>Weaknesses</h2>While a genius, Shiro has trouble dealing with the human aspects of games, like reading human opponents and predicting their moves. Another of her weaknesses is the fact that she can't swim, and is afraid of snakes. A human player doing something unpredictable can unsettle and confuse her, and she relies on Sora to tell her when a human opponent is leading her into a trap, as shown in their chess game with Tet.\n\nShe is also very weak even compared to Human/Imanity girls at the same ages. This is a result of her already-petite body and years of unhealthy lifestyles. Shiro make-up by keeping her physical works at minimum and left said work to others.\n\nHer other weakness is her reliance on Sora. She must be within range of sight and/or sound to Sora or else she'll fall into an almost catatonic state, as shown multiple times in both anime and manga.",

She is sweet, intelligent, clever, carefree, and fearless whether she is with or without Nishikata. After the 10 year time skips, she is shown to be more mature and responsible for her daughter Chi and the household she and Nishikata live in.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Takagi is a young girl with a slender build and an average height.

Due to Nishikata's facial expressions and mannerisms, she is able to easily read his mind and follow-up on what he sees, does, and thinks. Moreover, she does not scare easily, as seen when Nishikata tried to scare her with frightening videos and she barely reacted. Takagi is seen to be knowledgeable in myths, rumors, and romance stories, though whether she actually believes in them is debatable.\n",

She is typically dressed in the Shuchi'in school uniform.<h2>Personality</h2>Kaguya was a very cold and rational individual and only started to warm up to others after joining the student council. After joining the student council, she considered Miyuki Shirogane as one she would be fine to be in a relationship with if, and only if, he confesses first, thus she constantly plays mind games in trying to get Miyuki to confess.

This is reflected in the star pattern that can be found on most of her personal belongings.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Ai is a beautiful young girl with blonde hair that is most usually hair tied up at the left side of her head (She lets her hair down with a small braid tied on the right side when she's disguising as Haysaca A. Smithee) and blue eyes. Her expressions are flexible depending on the need and can express any emotion ranging from a cold stare to a look of pure love.

Not many people know about her true personality and it is apparently similar to Kaguya Shinomiya's personality. Despite being a part of the Shinomiya house, she is more loyal to Kaguya and acts more in the interest of Kaguya's happiness than to the Shinomiya house itself, going so far as to directly disobey orders from higher ups and disguising herself as Kaguya to let her enjoy the summer fireworks once.\n<h2>History</h2>The Hayasaka family was once prominent, but lost their conflict to the Shinomiya family and, noted for their fine bloodline, were absorbed into it.

She is one of the main characters of the KonoSuba series.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Megumin is a young girl with shoulder-length dark brown hair (smooth black in light novel) and crimson-colored eyes. She wears a classical witch attire such as a black cloak with gold border, choker, wizard's hat, fingerless gloves, and carries a black staff. Though she jokingly claims that her eyepatch seals her immense power, she sees it as a stylish sense of fashion due to her chuunibyou tendencies.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Megumin is a straightforward girl, who speaks in an old-style Japanese dialect. She can be very hyper and lively at times and has chuunibyou tendencies like the rest of the Crimson Demon villagers. She is very intelligent, but has very little self-control, especially when it comes to using Explosion magic. She has no problem wasting her spell on empty plains or abandoned castles, as long as she can use Explosion once a day.\n<h2>History</h2>She decided to become an Explosion mage after a busty older woman saved her with Explosion magic when she was young, and after learning it claims she \"must cast Explosion once a day or die.\"\n\nWhile still attending school, Megumin would swindle food from Yunyun every day since her parents couldn't afford meals. Due to her exceptional academic performance, Megumin was able to graduate early. When she left to travel alone, Yunyun predicted she would be \"at a loss due to a lack in the means of survival, begging a useless guy for a meal.\"\n\nAfter traveling to Axel Town, she quickly gained a reputation as a crazy Explosion fanatic, thus parties refused to accept her before meeting Kazuma and Aqua.\n<h2>Abilities</h2>Megumin is absolutely obsessed with Explosion magic. She devotes all of her skill points into improving the power of her explosions, shortening her casting time, and being able to cast the spell without chanting out loud. However, the severe mana drain, combined with Megumin never using points to increase her mana, results in her always collapsing after casting and becoming completely immobile. Also, her refusal to learn any other magic makes her entirely dependent on allies after casting. This is especially notable because there are other known Arch Wizards who can use Explosion magic can remain standing after casting, know at least one other skill, and can fight alone if necessary.",

She is a crusader with masochist tendencies who joins Kazuma's party early on.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>A tall, beautiful young woman, Darkness gives the appearance of a cool beauty. She is well-endowed and also has light blue eyes and straight, long blonde hair, usually kept in a ponytail tied with a braid and red hair clips secured on both sides of her bangs. She is usually seen clad in black, white, and yellow armour, with a metal shoulder plate on her left side, and a wing-like cloth perched upon her right shoulder.\n<h2>Personality</h2>As a crusader, Darkness initially presents herself with an aura of pride and nobility, preaching about her duty to shield others from harm. She speaks in a very serious tone of voice and often comes off as very mature.\n\nDespite these outward appearances, however, it does not take long for Darkness to reveal her true character: that of a complete masochist. While she does want to protect others, her masochistic urges are what ultimately drive her to commit many of her “heroic” acts throughout the series, resulting in many onlookers viewing her as a role model for her supposed selflessness. Her masochism extends to verbal abuse as well, a running gag being how she often responds to Kazuma’s sharp insults with her reeling back in pleasure. Throughout the story, she becomes progressively more open about her true intentions, to the point where she blatantly reveals her reason for becoming a crusader was in hopes of being sexually tortured by the Demon King, and that her ideal husband is an abusive alcoholic who would force her to sell her body for money.\n<h2>History</h2>Darkness rarely talked about herself or her background. When she does talk, it is usually about her twisted fantasies. However, we get some subtle hints that she has a high-class background, such as how she conducted herself (when she is not in her masochistic mode) or how her family sent them the very expensive snow crabs as a house-warming gift.\n\nWe later learned that she is a high noble, belonging to the prestigious Dustiness family. While Darkness disapproves of abusing her high position, showing her family badge alone will get immediate obedience from most officials and knights. In LN 8, she started to serve as the acting lord of Axel town in her father's stead, after the previous lord mysteriously disappeared, thought to be in hiding from his criminal and corruption charges.",

Aqua's clothes carry a blue color scheme, with her ordinary attire consisting of a vest, detached sleeves, thigh-high boots, an extremely short miniskirt, and a transparent underskirt. She also wears a divine relic in the form of a translucent pink hagoromo, which can disappear and reappear around her at her will.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Aqua has an interesting yet troublesome personality. She is high-spirited, cheerful, and carefree, but rarely thinks about the consequences of her actions. While she doesn't force her beliefs onto others, Aqua always acts or speaks on her whims; so, she can behave very inappropriately in many situations. It is also very easy to taunt Aqua with jeers or lure her with praises. Since Aqua, as a goddess, thrives on praise/worship points, she usually performs good deeds, but then immediately ruins her own merits by seeking praises aggressively and persistently. Also, while many of her 'good deeds' turn out fine, Aqua is very short-sighted, and some of these \"good deeds\" actually turn out to be complete disasters.\n<h2>History</h2>Aqua is worshiped by the Axis Order in the Fantasy World. Though hundreds of years had been passing in the Fantasy World since she started sending Japanese people there before being dragged to it herself by Kazuma, because of the difference in which time passes between the fantasy world and heaven she says to Kazuma that she has barely lived a bit longer than him.",

With this question he felt embarrassed and acted impulsively, calling Menma \"ugly\" and ran out. Instead of crying, Menma smiled and chased the embarrassed Jinta.

Back then for reasons not known to her she was considered a rather special child spent most of her days isolated from the other eleven villagers in a place called the \"Princess Room\" with only Fortuna, her doll and spirits for company. While she normally obeyed her aunt and loved her, deep down a part of Emilia resented her and the village for stripping her of freedom, constantly hiding things from her.",

    "description": "Kosaki Miyanagi née Onodera (小野寺 小咲, Onodera Kosaki) is one of the main characters of the Nisekoi series. She is one of the love interest of Raku Ichijō.\n<h2>Background</h2>Kosaki comes from a family of pastry chefs; all of whom specialize in making and decorating candies. However, her father is missing for the most part of the series and is hinted to have his own work to deal with. Thus, Kosaki has since been living with her eccentric mother and her feisty younger sister in their Japanese candy shop. Ironically, despite this environment, she grows up to be very timid by nature.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Kosaki is discreet, innocent, and slightly timid. She is very kind, taking care of Raku Ichijō when he is wounded or ill. Generally, she opts to think carefully before acting, as seen when she stalls her confession to Raku in consideration that he may have feelings for Chitoge Kirisaki.\n\nAt times, Kosaki shows signs of lacking self-confidence and often needs the support of Ruri Miyamoto (Kosaki's best friend). This is also proven by the fact that Kosaki's younger sister is very over-protective of her (even though Kosaki is older than Haru). In confrontations with Raku, Kosaki initially needs encouragement from Ruri to attempt any form of contact as she lacks self-confidence around him. \n<h2>Appearance</h2>Kosaki is a fair-skinned teenage girl with dark brown and shoulder-length with one long strand of hair which she keeps combed neatly to the left side of her face and chocolate brown eyes. Kosaki is average in height and has a thin figure. She looks a lot like her mother. She has the school uniform as most of her classmates do which is a half-sleeved or long-sleeved (depending on the season) white shirt with a blue sailor-style collar attached at the lower part of her neck that connects a thin orange tie that is laced through a loop at the end of the shirt, making a little part of the tie to reach the skirt. The skirt reaches around the upper thighs and is a blue-colored fabric that is accompanied by her white knee-length socks and brown slip-on shoes.",

    "description": "Chitoge Ichijō (一条 千棘, Ichijō Chitoge; (née Kirisaki (桐崎)) is the main female protagonist of the Nisekoi series. She is the daughter of Adelt Wogner Kirisaki and Hana Kirisaki She served as the fake girlfriend of Raku Ichijō for the next three years of her school life to prevent a war from starting between their families.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Chitoge is an attractive young woman with stunning features, slim build, and fair skin with a pale complexion. She has beautiful waist-length blond hair with pink tips at the end of her hair and strikingly aqua-blue eyes. Coupled with her height - tall by most standards - and her natural figure, many people associate her with a supermodel. Her most notable feature is the red ribbon that she always uses to tie her hair which was given by her mother. This is from when she was quite young, but she still prefers to wear this specific one though her mother has offered to buy her many more. In the manga, it was noted that her ribbon looked like the one the girl on Kosaki Onodera's picture book had.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Chitoge is somewhat a forgetful, stern and bold girl. However, once someone gets to know her better, she becomes very talkative and nice. Similar to Raku Ichijō, Chitoge is the type to go out of her way to help someone. For example, when Raku lost his pendant once again from the chain being broken, Chitoge had secretly gotten the Beehive gang to help fix it for him and gave it back later that night.\n\nChitoge is somewhat oblivious when it comes to love and others' love interests, for example, how she didn't know what Seishirō Tsugumi’s \"symptoms\" were, which were actually love. She is also very athletic as she can easily jump over the school's walls and swim the length of the school pool in a couple of seconds\n<h2>Background</h2>Chitoge originally lived with Adelt Wogner Kirisaki (Chitoge's father) in the United States until she transferred to another school in Japan, where she is now currently attending. With her father being the leader of the infamous Bee Hive Gang, it has caused multiple problems for Chitoge during her childhood as she was unable to make friends as they disliked her. Being under constant watch by Claude Ringheart (Chitoge's bodyguard), the students from her childhood also disliked her. However, when she was young, she met and befriended a hitwoman in-training named Seishirō Tsugumi, who, to the current day, she is still friends with. Chitoge also seems to have a few problems with her mother, who has very high expectations for her, making Chitoge somewhat of a perfectionist who excels in both sports and academics.",

She is the daughter of the former CEO of RECT Inc.. Asuna was one of the 10,000 players trapped in «Sword Art Online», where she was the sub-leader of the «Knights of the Blood» (KoB) guild. Her skills with the rapier had her earned her the nickname «The Flash» (閃光, Senkō).\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Asuna has long, orange-brownish chestnut hair and hazel eyes. In the early levels of SAO, she wore a dark red leather tunic with a lightweight copper breastplate and leather pants with boots up to the knees along with a hooded cape. After joining the «Knights of the Blood», she wore a red and white uniform that all KoB members wear and wielded a rapier made by Lisbeth, called the «Lambent Light». Asuna's avatar as Creation Goddess Stacia maintains her chestnut hair and light brown eyes. She wears armor with a pearly shine and a long skirt consisting of countless fine fabrics.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Asuna originally did not care about dying in the game before meeting Kirito. That meeting drastically changed Asuna's personality and outlook on life. She soon takes most things Kirito says to heart and looks to him for help, using him as somewhat of a lifeline.\n\nAsuna is a kind and helpful young woman who, similarly to Kirito, cannot abandon another in trouble. She takes the game very seriously and is determined to clear it before Kirito tells her to enjoy SAO a bit. Asuna is also somewhat proud and despite her kind personality, she will not hesitate to get physical with those that challenge her authority or make fun of her abilities, such as cooking. She even challenged Kirito to a duel after an argument over how to handle a Field Boss. She is not afraid to act out on her own and will take matters into her own hands from time to time.\n<h2>Background</h2>Asuna lived a comfortable life in her large home in Setagaya with her mother, father, and her brother. She originally went to private, all-girl schools before the events of SAO.\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Asuna logged onto SAO after she borrowed her brother's NerveGear. He had acquired a copy of the game and a NerveGear through his connections but could not play the game on the opening day due to a sudden business trip. When she discovered that she and all of the players were trapped in SAO, she secluded herself inside of her rented room in the «Town of Beginnings» for two weeks before resolving to take her fate into her own hands. This led her to kill monsters at an incredible rate and level up in a quick fashion, even risking her life in the process.",

She is briefly mentioned in Chaos;Child, and she communicates via the in-universe Twitter (Twipo) in Robotics;Notes and Robotics;Notes DaSH.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Kurisu is a slender young woman with waist-length, reddish hair, and dull violet eyes. Her hair, which she prefers to let loose, ranges in ginger shades all the way from mahogany to auburn. Her hair color differs considerably in the anime (red) from the original VN (chestnut). The \"Kuri\" part of her name means chestnut, and her hair color is most likely meant to resemble the color of a chestnut.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Kurisu is generally a sensible, serious mature young woman, usually calm and collected even when someone is acting tense in front of her. However, she can also show a much more timid side at times. She is shown frequently to hate being nicknamed, as she dislikes all of the names that Okabe gives her, with 'The Zombie' bugging her most of all. Ironically, on the rare occasions Okabe uses her real name, she takes it as a sign that something is seriously wrong. Kurisu is also practical and a realist, almost to a fault; initially, she believes firmly that time machines are fiction and refuses to believe the Phonewave is one even after seeing it in action, claiming that Okabe had simply seen what he wanted to see. It takes the group's looking up SERN's research about time travel to finally convince Kurisu of the truth. However, in Steins;Gate 0, she doesn't deny the possibility of time machines and will build one herself if she had the materials.",

She also wears leggings underneath her clothing.\n\nWhen she attends to her work at May Queen Nyan-nyan, she wears a blonde wig tied into a long ponytail.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Mayuri possesses an extremely childish and naïve attitude for her age. While this may have something to do with her inability to accept the death of her grandmother when she was young, Okabe states at one point that she's always been a little bit different, though he never goes into any detail beyond this. Mayuri has a great fondness for cute things like Upa cushions, and likes to give cute nicknames to familiar people, like Okarin for Okabe, being a portmanteau of his last and first names Okabe Rintaro, even referring to herself as Mayushii, being a portmanteau of Mayuri Shiina.",

She is now the Katana Hero (刀の勇者 Katana no Yuusha).\n<h2>Appearance</h2>She has undergone some significant changes throughout the story. When Raphtalia is first introduced, she is a child that has long, unmanaged hair and a dirty cloth gown. After being purchased by Naofumi, he gave her a haircut to an acceptable length, gave her a bath, and bought her a much more suitable set of clothes to adventure in. As a Tanuki demi-human, Raphtalia is shown to have fluffy dog-like ears and an averagely sized bushy tail.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Raphtalia was initially very shy, sickly, and fearful as a result of her status as a slave, as well as suffering from trauma with memories of the destruction of her village. After the encounter with the two-headed dog monster, she overcomes the trauma from her parents' death at the hands of the Cerberus and acknowledges Naofumi as a hero in her own mind.\n<h2>Background</h2>Until the age of 10, Raphtalia lived in a small coastal village outside of Melromarc, where everyone lived in harmony until the first wave of calamity attacked. During the attack, Raphtalia and her parents fled their home but considering they could only dive into the sea to escape the monsters Raphtalia's parents made the ultimate sacrifice. Her parents pushed her off a nearby cliff as the wave approached them, and she watched as her parents were engulfed by the Cerberus. Raphtalia survived the fall and went back to find her parents, but was unsuccessful. Shortly thereafter a group of Melromarc Knights came to her village and killed all the adult survivors.

Formerly human, she was attacked and turned into a Demon by Muzan Kibutsuji. She is one of the main protagonists of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Nezuko is a petite young girl with fair skin, visibly large, prominent fangs, and sharp, claw-like nails that fade to red where they point. Her hair is long, dark brown and reaches just below her waist, turning an vermilion color as it passes her elbows, and appears to be crimped into large, straight ridges, worn side-swept drastically to her left. She has soft-looking, pale pink eyes that appear a lighter color around the rims of their irises, slanted downwards towards the sides of her face and framed by notably long eyelashes, the pupils of which can appear slit as she transforms. According to Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko was known as a great beauty in their home town.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Nezuko's original personality as a human was that of a kind and caring girl, who thought of others before herself much like her older brother, Tanjiro, and was a responsible elder sister to her younger siblings.\n\nAs a Demon, however, Nezuko seems to have forgotten a good portion of her memories as a human, besides those related to her family, and thus doesn't retain the exact personality she had before transformation. She is still very caring and protective towards humans who she sees as members of her family, although this is mainly due to the influence Sakonji Urokodaki had on her while she was asleep for two years. Nezuko also retains some of her human emotions, as she has been seen to cry when sad and smile when happy, but in general she appears more detached than her human cohorts, although she is still much calmer and less malicious than most Demons.\n<h2>History</h2>Nezuko grew up on a mountain alongside her older brother, Tanjiro, and the rest of her siblings and mother, as the eldest daughter of the Kamado family. She presumably took care of her younger siblings as an assistant to her mother, as is briefly witnessed prior to her family's death. Unlike Tanjiro, who was responsible for selling firewood in town, Nezuko would usually help out around the family home.",

She has shoulder-length hair that fades from black into dark purple, usually styled at the back of her head into a \"yakai-maki\" style and fastened with a white and purple butterfly ornament. She has split ear-length bangs that rise a little away from her head before falling down to frame her face, with two thinner chin-length strands below them. Shinobu is rather short in height and has been described as having a small and weak-looking build, which is later reinforced by her saying that she does not possess enough physical strength to cut a Demon's head off as the other Hashira do. According to Zenitsu Agatsuma, Shinobu is so cute, that she could easily make a living on her looks alone.\nShinobu wears the standard Demon Slayer uniform with gold buttons, consisting of a dark-purple tinted straight-lined black jacket and hakama pants that are tucked into a butterfly pattern fabric around her lower legs. She also wears a white haori that previously belonged to her older sister, which has a butterfly wing pattern that fades into a turquoise then pink color on the sleeves and bottom edges which are cuffed with a black and white dotted trim. She wears white sandals with purple straps for footwear.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Shinobu is rather laid-back, always having a smile on her face regardless of the situation she is in. She seems to enjoy teasing others and can be rather sadistic about it, enjoying most notably to pick on Giyu Tomioka. Despite her relaxed exterior and her initial claim of wanting to get along with Demons, she can be rather cruel towards them, which is seen when she kills the Older Sister Spider Demon after giving her false hope of helping her and also attempting to kill Nezuko Kamado without hesitation.

She had long, straight hair of a very dark gray color that reached just below her waist, worn down with two shorter clumps over her shoulders, and arched, ear-length bangs on either side of her face.

She also sported a pair of green and pink butterfly hairpins that she wore adorned on either side of her head - one of which was later used by her adoptive younger sister, Kanao Tsuyuri, as a memento. She also wore the white, light green and pink butterfly-patterned haori that Shinobu Kocho now wears in the present.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Kanae is shown to be a kind girl with an easygoing personality; in Shinobu and Kanao's flashbacks, she is almost always seen with a gentle smile on her face. When Sanemi Shinazugawa lashed out against their leader, Kagaya Ubuyashiki, she displayed concern for Kagaya and gently informed Sanemi how Kagaya truly cares for the Demon Slayers under his charge. Kanae also had a dream of someday being able to live peacefully alongside Demons despite all the suffering and death they have inflicted on humans, which inspired Shinobu to aspire to do the same.\nHowever, Kanae had a much stricter side, as shown when Shinobu was on the verge of defeat during her battle with Doma. Kanae's spirit ordered her to stand up and face her opponent, brushing away the excuses forming in her mind that she was too delicate to take on Demons. Kanae was also keenly observant, seeing through Doma's acting and lies, and deducing that he was in fact emotionless and empty.

However, Kanao also eventually developed her own desire to fight.\nDespite her perceived lack of emotion or desire, Kanao defied Shinobu and Kanae's wishes and took the final selection of her own volition, which would imply that her will had been strengthening all along.",

Ochaco seems to be very good at reading people, understanding the reasons for Izuku Midoriya and Katsuki Bakugo’s rivalry and being the first to notice when the usually collected Tsuyu Asui was upset. Her empathy and kindness are also seen in how well she gets along with her classmates. She is on good terms with everyone and is particularly close friends with several members of the class, including Izuku, Tenya Iida, Tsuyu, and so on.\n<h2>Quirk</h2>Zero Gravity (無重力ゼログラビティ Zero Gurabiti): Ochaco's Quirk gives her the power to nullify the effects of gravity on solid targets (living and nonliving) by touching them with the pads on her fingertips, causing them to become weightless and float. She is able to cancel the effect of her Quirk by touching her finger pads together.\nHer Quirk is good for restraint, as those affected are unlikely to fight back since they will keep floating upwards until they are released. Ochaco takes advantage of ravaged areas to gather wreckage while also exploiting the consequences of a destructive Quirk. She can easily clean up disaster zones while simultaneously figuring out the timing of her movements so as not to damage others.",

    "description": "Kyoka Jiro (耳じ郎ろう響きょう香か Jirō Kyōka), also known as the Hearing Hero: Earphone Jack (ヒアヒーローイヤホン＝ジャック Hia Hīrō Iyahon Jakku), is a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School, training to become a Pro Hero.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Kyoka is a petite, fair-skinned girl with a slender build. She has triangular, lazy-looking onyx eyes with notably long lower eyelashes and rather small eyebrows. Her hair is short, only around chin length, and is dark purple in color with an asymmetrical fringe, and two reflections shaped like sound waves on either side of her head. Her most prominent features are the flexible, plug-like earphone jacks hanging from each of her earlobes at the end of two thin cords, which act like extra limbs; she seems to be able to control these at will, and they are very flexible, able to change length if so desired.\nUnlike the other students, Kyoka sometimes wears a waistcoat over her school uniform, in place of the usual U.A. blazer.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Kyoka has a pragmatic, unenthusiastic and teasing personality that is mostly shown to those she finds irritating, like her fellow classmate Denki Kaminari, whose cluelessness makes him an easy target for her snarky comments. Kyoka is not always like this though, as she does enjoy socializing with others, in which case she is usually nice and friendly.\n<h2>Quirk</h2>Earphone Jack (イヤホンジャック Iyahon Jakku): Kyoka's Quirk is that she has a pair of headphone jacks hanging from her earlobes. When the jacks are plugged into something, Kyoka can channel the sound of her heartbeat into it in the form of a violent vibration attack. She can stretch her earlobes several meters. This Quirk also allows her to hear minuscule sounds and vibrations from her surroundings.",

High School and is part of The Big 3.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Nejire is a fair-skinned girl of average height with wide, curious eyes. Her upper eyelashes long and thick, and her irises are a royal blue where her pupils are white. Her hair is periwinkle, and it reaches all the way down to her knees, twisting around itself at her waist and curving inwards around her legs. She has side-swept bangs, tucked behind her ears on the right and hanging just over her eyes on the left, and two short clumps of hair on either side of her face, curved towards her face on the right and behind it, under her ear, on the left. According to the boys at U.A., she’s more of the \"cute kind\" than the \"sexy kind.\"\nNejire wears a waistcoat in place of the normal U.A. blazer with her school uniform like Kyoka Jiro occasionally does.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Nejire is naturally a very kind, talkative, and endlessly curious girl. She shows great interest in people's unique physical features and is easily distracted by them. Due to this, Nejire can be very blunt, often asking rather invasive or off-putting questions.\nNejire is an affectionate person and a \"free spirit,\" someone who has a genuine passion for learning new and strange things and isn't afraid to speak her mind or show how she feels. She seems to like knowing more than others, but not in a proud way, as she just enjoys explaining things to people and sharing her knowledge. She is mentioned to act like a kindergartner due to her childish glee.\n<h2>Quirk</h2>Wave Motion (波は動どう Hadō): Nejire's Quirk grants her the ability to convert her own vitality into energy and release it in the form of exceptionally powerful spiral shockwaves. Since the energy travels in a spiral, it's not very fast. Overusing this Quirk will cause Nejire to suffer from great exhaustion, due to it using her own stamina as a power source.\nNejire can release the shockwaves from her hands as an offensive blast. She can also release the energy from her feet to increase her mobility and allow her to fly.",

She has very wide, innocent-looking eyes, which are bright red in color. Poking out from the right side of her forehead is a small, brown horn, which grows larger when her Quirk is activated.\nIn her first appearance, she's wearing a plain, short-sleeved dress, which is a dirty, pale tan color. Bandages are wrapped around both her arms and legs, stopping at her wrists and ankles, underneath which she is shown to have numerous scars.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Because her mother disowned her after she accidentally made her father disappear with her Quirk and the experiments she was subjected to by Kai Chisaki, Eri became a fearful and secluded girl, without anyone showing affection to her in her life. Apparently, Izuku Midoriya's touch was the first time she ever felt kindness, which overwhelmed her. When murderous intents are directed at her, she does not scream, nor cry and simply remains silent, because she knows she has no choice but to accept whatever is to happen to her.\nEri is, however, willing to let herself go with Kai in order to protect those that help her. She feels guilt over other people being hurt in order to rescue her.\n<h2>Quirk</h2>Rewind (巻き戻す Maki Modosu): Eri's Quirk allows her to reverse a living individual's body back to a previous state, allowing her to heal injuries and undo bodily modifications. She has even shown the ability to rewind someone's body to a point before they existed.\nAs a result of her Quirk mutating her body, Eri's blood is able to attack an individual's Quirk and stop its activation.\nThe source of her Quirk's power is located in the horn on her head, and the size of the horn dictates the strength of her power. It is also an accumulation-type Quirk, which means the power it emits has to build up over a period of time before becoming usable.",

She has slightly inward-tilting eyes, irises bright yellow and their pupils thin slits, making them somewhat resemble those of a cat, and her wide mouth is also rather feline, as both her upper and lower canines are more pointed and longer than the rest of her teeth. Her hair is a pale, dirty ash-blonde and is styled into two messy buns, numerous wild strands sticking out at all angles from their centers and where they’re fastened, a straight fringe and two chin-length side bangs to frame her face.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Himiko is a very cheerful girl, to the point of smiling even after having presumably killed someone, displaying apparent sadistic tendencies. This continues even when danger is imminent, as when Tomura Shigaraki was about to attack her, but it tends to stop when she is bored or annoyed. Himiko is frequently seen blushing seemingly out of excitement rather than embarrassment, giving her a permanent look of what appears to be lovesickness on her face. However, she has shown that she can easily be embarrassed, such as when she thinks people are coming on to her, or when she is naked when copying clothes of the people she has transformed into.\n<h2>Quirk</h2>Transform (変へん身しん Henshin): Himiko's Quirk grants her the ability to transform into a physical lookalike of another individual, as well as copy their voice. She can only transform into people whose blood she has ingested. The more blood she drinks, the longer she has access to that person's form. She can switch between the appearances of multiple people if she drinks the blood of more than one person. She can even duplicate a person's clothing, though, her own clothes would overlap the transformation, requiring her to get naked beforehand.\nUpon deactivating her Quirk or switching to another disguise, Himiko's disguise melts into a gray viscous liquid.",

Said to be the most pampered, or rather, the most beloved goddess by the other deities.Her Sumerian divine name was said to be Inanna (イナンナ, Inan'na), and that name is actually her older name. Ishtar is her Akkadian divine name. It means \"The Mistress of Heaven\". A goddess of Venus, a goddess who governs over the good harvests that brings prosperity to the people, and even a goddess who rules over war and destruction, she is a great goddess who, among the goddesses, was presented with many rights and Authorities from the gods. In Sumerian Mythology, she plays an active role as a dynamic goddess and as a goddess who is like the heroine of a story, possessing various anecdotes. Particularly among them, a famous one is her feeding the city of Uruk to a fearsome Divine Beast called the “Bull of Heaven”, seemingly an anecdote that caused the city to be on the brink of destruction; in any case, she is a goddess who is a nuisance to others.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>This form is not that of the goddess Ishtar herself, but a Pseudo-Servant condition in which a human that has a wavelength close to her own was made into a vessel.\n<h2>Personality</h2>In “Fate/Grand Order”, Ishtar has materialized as a Pseudo-Servant by possessing a human. Since Ishtar is egotistical, she behaves without paying any regard to the possessed human, but her nature is receiving a big influence from the human that was possessed. Originally, Ishtar is both deeply compassionate and cruel, but because the personality of the possessed human is more virtuous, her cruelty has retreated to the bottom of her heart, and her good side appears to have come out ahead of it.\nActive and extroverted. The goddess of war and good harvests that lives according to her own whims without being a slave to her own fixed position, all while having high intelligence and pride. Ishtar loves beautiful things, hates ugly things, and the things she desires are the things she absolutely takes hold of in her own hands. Even though she is smart, she is impulsive, and sometimes leaves with an unthinkable reckless abandon. In myths, Ishtar is commented by Gilgamesh as thus: “Inanna Isn’t she the most annoying goddess in the world!? She will destroy something that certainly doesn’t need to be destroyed, and she will also create something that doesn’t need to be created!” If Ishtar becomes ostentatious in this world, then surely in that way, she will invite chaos simultaneously.",

She is also very impatient, disliking people who don't answer her questions quickly enough. This, coupled with her own tragic childhood, caused many of her guildmates to avoid her due to her social awkwardness.

She is intelligent and has a very honest personality, is \"direct and open with her emotions\", and is easily swayed by the people around her. However, this also causes her to be \"very romantic\". She can be spontaneous and \"very ditzy\". Unlike the other Dragon Slayers, Wendy doesn't enjoy fighting, preferring to avoid it as much as possible. If, however, it's for the sake of her guild or friends, Wendy will fight without hesitation. However, after Doranbolt saved her and Carla from dying, with the destruction on one Face, Wendy cut her hair, deciding she would no longer cry and whine, and would continue to fight as long as her friends are fighting as well.",

Despite her smug expression and teasing behaviour, Ichika is shown to have a weakness to romantic moments happening to her; blushing whenever thoughts about it came to her mind.",

    "description": "Nino Nakano (中なか野の 二に乃の, Nakano Nino) is one of the main characters of the 5-toubun no Hanayome series. She is the second sister of the Nakano Quintuplets who usually acts as the mother of the family; cooking for them and taking care of their medical needs. Among the five sisters, she is the one who has the highest hostility towards Fuutarou Uesugi and often rebelled against him early in the series.\n<h2>Appearance</h2>Nino is a cute and cold-looking girl with waist-length or hip-length straight hair (but it is later cut to shoulder-length in Vol. 4 Ch. 46 and shown in Vol. 5 Ch. 47) that has square bangs hanging over her eyebrows. She has reddish-pink hair, ranging from light pink to telemagenta in Volume 1 and antique pink to red-violet in Volume 4.\nHer notable accessories are twin butterfly-shaped ribbons on both sides of her head. Like her sisters, she has dark blue eyes, an average height, a well-endowed figure and large breasts. She wears a long-sleeved sweater that covers her uniform and a pair of white thigh-high socks. Both her and Ichika Nakano use a handbag.\nShe is noted to be the more fashionable girl among the sisters, as she has various cute accessories and takes care of her nails. Her ears have yet to be pierced, but she plans to have them at least before marriage.\n<h2>Personality</h2>Nino has an outgoing personality and is socially aware, resulting in her having many friends and is a social butterfly. She has a sharp tongue and talks bluntly when confronting others, even to her sisters. Her rebellious attitude makes her the least cooperative girl among the sisters, making her archetype resemble that of a \"tsundere\".\nDespite the cold and rude front, Nino is caring and protective, like when she is touched by Fuutarou Uesugi's past; remarking that it is tearjerking. It is also evident by her willingness to act as the cook of the family, ignoring her care towards her own appearance (culinary activities may lead to foul odor, damaged nails, etc.). She is also shown to always have band-aids with her, possibly as a precaution to Yotsuba Nakano's active behavior.\nHer interests seem to lie more on romance than anything else. An example is when she wanted to watch a romance movie, whilst Itsuki Nakano preferred a science documentary instead. With this is mind, she likes to openly state her feelings for Fuutarou, regardless of whether it's in front of him or her sisters.\nAccording to Fuutarou, each Nakano Quintuplet has their own characteristics regarding their sheets, but in Nino's case, she will file her papers neatly.",

She has reddish-orange hair colour, ranging from light pink to salmon pink in Volume 1, and deep orange to orient red in Volume 4.

She is well-manned; never being late or missed a class, and always speaks politely.

She is often a wimp, be it about unfavourable situations, scary things or her stubborn self.\nShe has a huge appetite and is mostly seen eating something throughout the series. It appears that she doesn't mind treating her sisters unfairly when it comes to food-related topics. This shows where during one scenario when she proposed to her sisters to share their cakes; suspected to sample all the flavours by Ichika.",
